Our groups used a variety of ways to talk to each other during the course of Project 2.
Due to this, it was really hard to gather all of our conversations in one place. 
This was made even more difficult as we preferred to meet in person to get work done instead of messaging each other online.
This lead us to taking meeting minutes during all of the meeting we had. They can be found in the meetingMinutes folder.
This doesn't include the direct messages exchanged between the members and not shared in the group
WE HAVE ALSO NOTICED AN ISSUE WITH THE CONTRIBUTION GRAPH ON MAIN. IT DOES NOT REPRESENT THE ACCURATE CONTRIBUTION BECAUSE SOME MEMBERS HAD GIT CONFIG SET UP WRONG.
