This is our 1st meeting.
Each member discussed what they planned on doing in the next week
  Chase: Find out why demo accounts do not work.
  Justin: Start working on getting the right badges inside of the repo.
  Andrew: See why the flow of the app is broken and why user cant get their deliveries.
  Mukul: Revamp frontend to make it look better.

We choose Boozebuddies it seems like a fun project but after going through it as a group we see that it has more problems than the demo led on.
We have a long road ahead.
